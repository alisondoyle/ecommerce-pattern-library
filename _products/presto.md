name: "Nike Air Presto Off-White White"
descripton: |
After an absolute frenzy over Virgil Abloh's first iteration, the Nike Air Presto Off White is back-- in black. In a Richard Lewis-approved colorway (word to LD), this shoe is dressed in a monochromatic black. In addition, it features a white Nike Swoosh sewn onto the lateral side. Finally, "AIR" is written in classic Virgil fashion on the side heel, completing this deconstructed, utilitarian #vibe..
